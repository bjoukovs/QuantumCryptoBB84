Title: Programming a Quantum Network

Abstract:
In this project, the quantum key distribution protocol BB84 is implemented using the SimulaQron library.
The simulated network is composed of two main peers Alice and Bob exchanging authenticated classical and quantum
messages using Eve as an intermediate relay. The BB84 states are sequentially generated by Alice and sent to Bob who
measures them. Then, both peers compare a subset of their measurement outcomes for agreeing measurement basis to
estimate the error rate. Since the noise-free case is considered, a resulting null error rate allows Alice and Bob to
compute a one-bit key using a seeded extractor, thus performing the privacy amplification step. If the error is
non-null due to Eve measuring the exchanged qubits on the fly, the error is likely to be non-null and the protocol is
aborted. Experiments were conducted using a varying number of qubits. Even if the attack of Eve was successfully
discovered each time, the results highlight the high sensitivity of the error rate when only few qubits are used.
